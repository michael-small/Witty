## UI Ideas

UI components meant to be widely reused will go in this folder. I made this file as a placeholder to make sure the `/UI` folder is established in this early structuring of the project.

Use [CSS Baseline from MUI](https://material-ui.com/components/css-baseline/) for global component styling. SCSS/SASS may be used in conjunction, but the state of those frameworks is a bit turbulent as of recently with maintanence and deprecations.

Global styles: 
-    Primary Color: #1a2b51
-    Secondary/Accent Color: #ff9c00
-    Font: arial
